1: started working on initializing folders and databases Folder structure proposed:
                                        pwmanager1.0 (main folder)
                                        /           |             \
                                      /             |               \
                                    /               |                 \
                               path.txt          main.py            database(sqlite)
    
2: make a interface for simpler navigation. I think using Tkinter should be good enough and it seems good.
3: think about securing information and movement of data
